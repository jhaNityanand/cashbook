- `App.vue`: Root component
- `router/`: Vue Router configuration
- `stores/`: Pinia stores (business, member, cashbook, transaction)
- `pages/`: Page components (BusinessList, BusinessView)
- `components/`: Reusable components (BusinessForm, MemberForm, CashbookForm, CashbookView)

Validation errors are returned in the following format:

```json

  "errors": {
    "name": ["The name field is required."],
    "email": ["The email must be a valid email address."]
  }
}
```
